# oh, i didn't know this is called octothorpe. Such a long name. I will forgot it tomorrow.
# I used call it hash, but the book said call it "the long name" or pound. So from now on i will call it pound. This will make me more professional. hahahaha!
# I like to write a lot after the pound, so that 1 month later, I still understand what I wrote.
# When I comment, I hope these text editors can autocorrect, but when I code, I'm glad that they cannot.
# As I said, I write a lot of comments...

print("I could have code like this.") # yay! this yay will not be printed

# neither will this "YAY".

#print("This will not run")

print("This will run.")
